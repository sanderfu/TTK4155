The interfacing functions have been implemented according to the official data sheet of the A\+Tmega162 and the relevant additional IC\textquotesingle{}s used, but details regarding the use of these data sheets are not documented in this node documentation. We therefore recommend having the relevant data sheets of the IC\textquotesingle{}s open when studying this documentation to get a complete understanding of the choices that has been taken along the way regarding operation modes, timer settings etc. It is not considered essential if the main purpose is to get a general overview of the node functionality.\hypertarget{index_game}{}\doxysubsection{Game Logic}\label{index_game}
The node introduces two game modes. In Game 1, the player starts with 10 points and have to keep as many points as possible within a given time frame. One point is lost every time the ball passes the \char`\"{}goal line\char`\"{}. In Game 2, points are given for every second the player keeps the ball away from the goal.\hypertarget{index_pcb}{}\doxysection{P\+CB}\label{index_pcb}
During the project term, a P\+CB has been designed to remove the need for breadboard usage for the node itself. The P\+CB Schematic was designed based on the breadboard layout, designed in Ki\+C\+AD and produced by J\+L\+C\+P\+CB in Shenzhen, China. A separate repository for the P\+CB designed this term can be found at \href{https://github.com/sanderfu/ttk4155-pcb}{\texttt{ https\+://github.\+com/sanderfu/ttk4155-\/pcb}} \hypertarget{index_schematic}{}\doxysubsection{Schematic}\label{index_schematic}
