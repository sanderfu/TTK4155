This page contains the documentation for node 2 of the term project in T\+T\+K4155. The main purpose of this node is to control the motor based on user input in node 1 and send information back regarding playtime and score. The communication between nodes is done using the C\+AN protocol.\hypertarget{index_summary}{}\doxysection{Implementation summary}\label{index_summary}

The interfacing functions have been implemented according to the official data sheet of the A\+Tmega2560 and the relevant additional IC\textquotesingle{}s used, but details regarding the use of these data sheets are not documented in this node documentation. We therefore recommend having the relevant data sheets of the IC\textquotesingle{}s open when studying this documentation to get a complete understanding of the choices that has been taken along the way regarding operation modes, timer settings etc. It is not considered essential if the main purpose is to get a general overview of the node functionality.\hypertarget{index_game}{}\doxysubsection{Game Logic}\label{index_game}
The node introduces two game modes. In Game 1, the player starts with 10 points and have to keep as many points as possible within a given time frame. One point is lost every time the ball passes the \char`\"{}goal line\char`\"{}. In Game 2, points are given for every second the player keeps the ball away from the goal.
